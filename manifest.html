<div class="floating-box" id="chapter5">

<br><p><span>As many would claim, this time is not one that is to be celebrated, for that would hinder critical perspectives, that could possibly pose a solution to global warming. Yet celebrating is what we did when we decided to name the epoch to a Greek word that translates to Human. And glorifying it we did when we, very early one, saw an upward trend in CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, yet all continued to take advantage of the miracles fossil fuel burning brought us. The consequences of celebrating this epoch will mean the exclusion of a big portion of our species in obtaining pleasure from doing so. A closer look on our current habits reveal however, that we have grown accustomed to this act. Right now, we cannot look away from reality anymore. We know we will have to take action and face the consequences. If we let us take down by all negativity surrounding the issue, we will end up in a downwards spiral that will give us no prosper future to strive towards to. To celebrate is to positively tackle the issue by empowering ourselves even more, because we want to survive!<span></p>
	<p id="p2"><span>We are able to utilise our current systems and have contemporary media entertainment and advertising anticipate the issue in a tone of voice that will be heard by its responders. This is another example of using our powers to adapt when nature demands us to.</span></p><br> -->
