<br><h2>0. The Grand Introduction</h2>
<h4>Are there parties that benefit from the Anthropocene and how?</h4><br><br>
			 
<!-- <p>Among the white nationalists on 4chan’s “politically incorrect,” or /pol/ board and on “alt-right” Twitter — or anywhere you might run into a picture of Pepe the Frog — there is a cryptic but popular saying: “Praise Kek.” Kek is how <em>World of Warcraft</em> translates “lol” when it’s revealed to members of opposing alliances, but it is also, conveniently, a name for a serpent-headed Egyptian chaos god.<p><br> -->

<p><em>Sunrise.</em> A hairy, male figure erects from his cave, stands on both of his feet and looks up to the morning sky. The night before it had, through its darkness, cast the soft light of a countless distant flickering dots. Having accepted his lack of knowledge on this phenomena, the freshly evolved Homo Sapiens goes through his tasks of the day. Hunt for food for his female partner and their new born, don’t get killed in the process by other prehistorical creatures; use deeply rooted instincts to survive. Eat or be eaten.</p><br>

<p>It would take another 6 million years before the descendants of this figure could go through their days, without the constant fear of being eaten alive. As their physical appearance changed, so too would their daily routine. Their strong survival instinct would be blunted for more practical ones. We would start to evolve our days around working, in order to experience leisure out of a vast range of activities. Sure the survival instinct is still in Homo Sapiens today, and will get millions of people out of life threatening situations for far more years, but it will not be triggered as frequently.</p><br>

<p>During this extended period, it is only in the last several thousand years that humans developed to beings who would rather disassociate themselves from nature. To this day, this summarises the Western ideology where man uses technology to shape and control his surroundings to his will. We know what caused the hairy figure to see flickering dots in the night sky. We even catalogued every single visible one, send vessels with ultra high definition cameras into space to document them and use the same cameras to look deep into the vastness of space. With this information we try to give meaning to our lives and seek for answers to questions that transcend our imagination.</p2><br><br>

<div id="img"></div>

<p><em>But back on Earth, orbiting approximately 36.000 km above its surface,</em> satellites equipped with similar cameras capture our rather destructive presence on the Blue Planet. Like an ant colony shaping their nest, we grew into an ever expanding society. We transformed millions of square kilometres of land into agriculture and vibrant, illuminating cities to serve billions of us. Surely the radical transformations we have made in the last several thousand years cannot be without consequences.</p>
	<p id="p2">The evolved human presented itself to Earth as a geological force, polluting the seas and skies, the ground and what’s underground. Depleting, decaying, mutating and exhausting its sources on a massive scale. We do everything in our power to make our time on Earth worthwhile, but these developments are causing the slow but steady demise of our current ecosystems.</p><br>

<p>The planet’s carbon and nitrogen cycles, ocean chemistry and biodiversity are each products of millions of years of evolution. These states are being overwritten by human agents and have been radically and permanently disrupted by our activity. The Industrial Revolution in the middle of the 19th century opposed a big treat to the whole, but it seems that the Great Acceleration has started a Machine that began the sudden and dramatic jump in consumption around 1950. This followed a huge rise in global pollution and the collapse of agricultural diversity. Despite having names of Greek shepherds — Polystyrene, Polyvinyl, Polyethylene — plastic, and the explosion in the use of it, would meanwhile infiltrate nature and act as as a permanent, unwanted host in the next 25 years.</p><br>

<p>As many geologists process their data and map out our impact, a big sum of them have already established the damage. Our soil has been affected in such a way that we catapulted ourselves into a new geological epoch. We gave it a name, and ironically enough glorified ourselves in it. <em>The Anthropocene.</em> A geological subdivision based on the figure of the Anthropos, being Greek for Human.</p>
	<p id="p2">A working group of geologists, climate scientists, archaeologists, and others voted for the Great Acceleration to be a solid starting point for the era. Atomic testing in the 1950’s and the changes that came with those events started an exponential growth in the pollution of our home planet. While the Anthropocene working group is asking the <em>International Commission on Stratigraphy</em> (ICS), the bureaucracy that governs geologic time, to recognise the Anthropocene as series (the stratigraphic equivalent of an epoch), the product of it is all too visible.</p><br>

<p>But the Anthropocene did not one day come falling from the sky through our carbon dioxide thickened atmosphere, and was certainly not drilled up from the soils of our planet by oil extractors. No, the Anthropocene has been lurking in the dark, visible enough for governments, politics and CEOs to both recognise and neglect the consequences. They had other plans and revolt against an epoch was not on their schedule. Numerous parties that call the shots benefit tremendously from our self-destruction. Parties that rather not talk about environmental degradation. But what if they did? What if they acknowledged their actions and actually endorse them? Could that mindset pass on to the masses who, through our economic systems, act on their behalf? Could this make for a new way of thinking about our epoch? In other words, is it possible to reshape our perception, and see the Anthropocene as a collective achievement of the modern Homo Sapiens?</p>
	<p id="p2">This thesis will approach the Anthropocene in an onorthodox way and look for ways to glorify our actions that led to this rather sudden change.</p><br><br><br>
